What is Bs?
BS, also known as Cheat or I Doubt It, is a fast-paced card game that involves deception, strategy, and bluffing. Typically played with a standard deck of cards and suited for 3 to 10 players, the objective is to be the first to get rid of all your cards. Players take turns playing cards face down while announcing their value, but they can lie about the cards they are playing. Other players can challenge a claim by calling “BS” if they suspect deceit, prompting the player to reveal their cards. If the challenged player was truthful, the challenger must pick up the entire discard pile; if the player was lying, they must pick up the pile. The game continues until one player runs out of cards, creating a fun and competitive atmosphere that encourages cunning tactics and social interaction.

here an article that may help you understand the game: https://www.instructables.com/How-to-play-BSA-game-of-bluffing/

This project I made features dynamic card management with robust input validation and error handling, ensuring smooth gameplay and user engagement

So here are the instructions in how to play this in the terminal

Firstly download BS.py

Then in the terminal Run the following command to start the game:

Next, it will ask you Who's Playing? once all players are registered type in "No one else" so the game can start
Whoever was first in the list of name entered will start first so make sure that the first person enters "No one else" so no one peaks at your cards!
Here's an example:

Then it will display it is the first player's turn and only he/she will be able to look at their cards!



So first it will ask you how many cards you want to place down you can only place max 4!

Next you place one of the cards down from your hand
Note: No need to specify what suit it is just the rank is fine
as you can see in this example we place a "3"
and since earlier we said we are going to place only one card down
we are gonna specify that we will place only one "3" from the deck down

Then it will ask what we will "Say" we placed
Note: "The Last card placed:" tell us what the last player placed before that so we must either place 1 card with the rank higher, the same or lower 
in this case its nothing
and we will tell the truth for the first turn

continue the game, pass the device to the next player in line. They will reveal the cards that Jhon claimed to have played. If someone believes that Jhon was dishonest, they can call "BS" by typing in his name. If they are correct and Jhon was lying, he must pick up the entire pile of cards. However, if Jhon was telling the truth, then the player who called him out will have to take the pile instead. This adds an exciting element of strategy and bluffing to the game!
in this case no one calls BS

Then the next round begins and its mats turn
mat decides to play 2 cards because he has two "4s"
also notice this time that at the last placed card it shows the last card placed
it also gives you a suggestion what to say you placed in order not to get caught bluffing by accident for your first few games.

So here is an example of Jill calling bluff on Mat and her being wrong
