This is the Stock Price Scraper & AI Predictor I developed using Python, Flask, HTML and CSS. 
The project involved creating a web scraper to collect detailed data for specific stocks, 
retrieving key information like price history and other relevant metrics. Using the gathered historical data, 
It gets trained using a linear regression model to predict future stock prices. 
This model was designed to provide accurate predictions for the stockâ€™s price on the following day, 
leveraging trends and patterns from the past data to inform its forecasts.

Here are some images on my project

To run this project, you need to download the file highlighted in yellow:

Next, open Visual Studio Code or any other text editor of your choice. For this demonstration, I will be using Visual Studio Code.

Click the Open File button to load the project:

Next, open Visual Studio Code or any other text editor of your choice. For this demonstration, I will be using Visual Studio Code.

Once the files are loaded, locate the Start Debugging button in the top left corner of Visual Studio Code:

Then, go to the terminal and find the link to the website, which is highlighted in red:

Once you open it, your screen should look like this:

Now, type in a stock symbol.
Note: Ensure you enter the exact ticker symbol; otherwise, the system will not be able to retrieve results for that stock.

With this setup, you can easily access the stocks you're interested in, along with predictions for tomorrow's stock values.


Update: Currently, the link used to scrape data for the prediction model is down for maintenance. Once it is back online, I will reintroduce the historical values scraped from the web. Until then, the charts and prediction model will rely on hard-coded values, which may lead to temporary inaccuracies in the AI model and graphs. Everything else should function correctly.
