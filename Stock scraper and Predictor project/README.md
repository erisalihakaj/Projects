This is the Stock Price Scraper & AI Predictor I developed using Python, Flask, HTML and CSS. 
The project involved creating a web scraper to collect detailed data for specific stocks, 
retrieving key information like price history and other relevant metrics. Using the gathered historical data, 
It gets trained using a linear regression model to predict future stock prices. 
This model was designed to provide accurate predictions for the stockâ€™s price on the following day, 
leveraging trends and patterns from the past data to inform its forecasts.
