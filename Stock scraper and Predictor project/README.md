This is the Stock Price Scraper & AI Predictor I developed using Python, Flask, HTML and CSS. 
The project involved creating a web scraper to collect detailed data for specific stocks, 
retrieving key information like price history and other relevant metrics. Using the gathered historical data, 
It gets trained using a linear regression model to predict future stock prices. 
This model was designed to provide accurate predictions for the stockâ€™s price on the following day, 
leveraging trends and patterns from the past data to inform its forecasts.

Ok now in order to run this project you will need to download the file highlighted in yellow

Next, open up Visual Studio Code or any other editor. For this example, I am going to use Visual Studio Code
First Press The Open File button and load up the project

Then once the files are loaded, find the start debugging button on the top left of Visual Studio Code

Then go ahead and type a stock symbol. 
Note: (Make sure it is the exact initials otherwise it will be unable to provide a result for that stock)


As you can see in this following example we type in the stock for Apple(AAPL) and it returns us 
information such as the current price the most recent news and a prediction for tomorrow's value
